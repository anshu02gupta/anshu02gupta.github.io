## Media Highlights
My paper on [*the mass assembly history of massive galaxies*](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab7b6d) published in The Astrophysical Journal in April 2020 
was released in the press by [ASTRO3D](https://astro3d.org.au/) and UNSW
titled [*Hungry galaxies grow fat on the flesh of their neighbours*](https://astro3d.org.au/hungry-galaxies-grow-fat-on-the-flesh-of-their-neighbours/).
