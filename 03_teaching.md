**1. [Astronomer in residence, Uluru](../astronomer_in_residence.pdf)** <br/>

I was part of [ASTRO3D](https://astro3d.org.au/) funded 
[astronomer in residence](https://www.ayersrockresort.com.au/events/detail/astronomer-in-residence-program) 
program at Ayers Rock resort deep within the Australian outback near Uluru. 
I spent my days educating kids and adults from all walks life about astronomy 
and Australia's role in it. The sense of wonder and amazement that astronomy inspires in eyes of people 
irrespective of background and knowledge is a sight to behold. I spent the nights listening to aboriginal stories about the 
Giant Emu in the sky at one of the best sites in the world for night sky viewing.
