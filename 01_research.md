### [MOSEL Survey: Properties of 12 billion year old galaxies](https://sites.google.com/view/moselsurvey/home)  

**1. Epoch of Reionisation through cosmic noon analogues** <br/>
The Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) is a key phase transition in our Universe's history, 
where it went from neutral to fully ionised. We will build a benchmark sample of EoR analogues 
of super star-forming dwarf galaxies at z=3-4 to estimate the production efficiency of 
ionising radiation and their escape fraction in the "first galaxies". Gupta+2021 in prep.

**2. Mass assembly history of massive galaxies** <br/>
Our current cosmological paradigm says that galaxies initially build up their stellar disk through 
in situ star formation, but at some point mergers take over. After that, most stellar mass 
is accreted from other galaxies. Our observations show that this transition for massive 
galaxies happens between z=2-3. Please see [Gupta+2020a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01725) 
for more details.

Outflows in dwarf galaxies at z~3 The star formation effciency of galaxies across 12 Gyrs is uniformly low at ~ 1%, and galactic-scale gas outflows might be responsible. 
From the ZFOURGE survey, we have identified "first burst" galaxies with blended.
Hb+[OIII] Equivalent Widths (EW) > 600 Angstroms (~ 3 times larger than EW of a typical star-forming galaxy at (z > 3). 
With stellar mass down to log(M*) ~ 8.5 and extreme emission lines, these dwarf galaxies are
ideal for testing various supernovae prescriptions. I have been awarded 3 nights on KMOS/VLT to quantify 
outflow properties in these nascent galaxies. These galaxies are ideal progenitors of galaxies responsible for 
reionization of the universe.

### Chemical evolution in dense environment 
 
Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound systems in the Universe. Baryonic
processes such as gas removal, gas heating and/or gas accretion makes the galaxy evolution in cluster environment really complex.
I use observations and the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to study chemical evolution in cluster
environment. Our research shows that signs of environment-dependent chemical evolution appear 9 billion years ago, and even before
galaxies fall onto a large-scale cluster halo. Please see
