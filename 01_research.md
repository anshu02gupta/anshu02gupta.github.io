### MOSEL Survey: Properties of 12 billion year old galaxies  

**1. Kinematics of massive galaxies** <br/>
Galaxies at z~3.0 lie at an important juncture in the rise and fall of cosmic star formation density.
The strong burst of star formation at z~3.0 is required to explain the appearance of massive galaxies 
with suppressed star formation rates at z<3.0. 
I am using the MOSFIRE spectroscopic data to analyse the kinematic properties of star-forming galaxies at z~3
from MOSEL survey. By comparing with cosmological simulations I am finding a transition in the primary growth mechanism of 
massive galaxies between z=3 to z=2. 

**2. Outflows in dwarf galaxies at z~3**<br/>
The star formation effciency of galaxies across 12 Gyrs is uniformly low at ~ 1%, and galactic-scale gas out
flows might be responsible. From the ZFOURGE survey, we have identified "first burst" galaxies with blended
Hb+[OIII] Equivalent Widths (EW) > 600 Angstroms (~ 3 times larger than EW of a typical star-forming galaxy at
z > 3). With stellar mass down to log(M*) ~ 8.5 and extreme emission lines, these dwarf galaxies are
ideal for testing various supernovae prescriptions. I have been awarded 3 nights on KMOS/VLT to quantify 
 outflow properties in these nascent galaxies. These galaxies are ideal progenitors of galaxies responsible for 
 reionization of the universe. 
 

### Chemical evolution in dense environment 
 
**3. Self-enrichment versus enrichment via accretion in dense environment**<br/>
 I use galaxy clusters, which are the largest gravitationally bound systems in the Universe, to understand the impact of 
 baryonic
processes such as gas removal, gas heating and/or metal accretion on the chemical enrichment histories of galaxies.
Using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG,
I find that signs of environment-dependent chemical evolution appear 9 billion years ago, and even before
galaxies fall onto a large-scale cluster halo. I plan to use IllustrisTNG simulations to quantify 
the role of self-enrichment versus enrichment via accretion
of metal-rich gas in the chemical evolution of cluster galaxies.
