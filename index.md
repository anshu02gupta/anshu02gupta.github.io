I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.physics.unsw.edu.au/staff/anshu-gupta). 
I finished my graduate degree in 2018 at Australian National University with Prof. Lisa Kewley. 

I consider myself first and foremost a scientist whose objects of interest happen to be astronomical objects.
Astronomical objects fascinate me because a knowledge of physics 
from quantum-scale  to large-scale gravitational effects is essential to fully understand astronomical objects. 
Also, who has not wondered about the twinkling shinny, bright lights in the night sky as a kid.


I use direct observations from some of the largest telescopes in the world, and  
state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations to understand the origin and evolution of 
 galaxies like our own Milky Way. My specific interests lie in figuring out the factors affecting 
 the production and distribution of chemical elements like Oxygen, Carbon and Nitrogen in galaxies.
