I am an astrophysicist trying to understand the origin and evolution of 
galaxies like our own Milky Way. I use optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations of galaxies 
from some of the largest telescopes in the world such as Keck in Hawaii and VLTs in Chile, 
and combine them with the state-of-the-art cosmological simulationsand theoretical models, which is 
essential to fully understand the physics of galaxy formation and evolution.

I am an ASTRO3D fellow at the Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy, Perth ([CIRA](https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/anshu-gupta-55ba041d/)). Before this I was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of New South Wales ([UNSW](https://www.physics.unsw.edu.au/staff/anshu-gupta)), Sydney with Prof. Kim-Vy Tran. 
I did my graduate studies (2018) at the Australian National University ([ANU](https://anu.edu.au/)), Canberra with Prof. Lisa Kewley and Dr. Tiantian Yuan. 

I am currently leading [The MOSEL survey](https://sites.google.com/view/moselsurvey/home), which aims to study the detailed physical properperties of the Epoch of reionisation analogs at z~3.

[//]:  I grew up in India, where I did a dual bachelors and masters degree in Physics at
[//]:  [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali](http://www.iisermohali.ac.in/).  
[//]:  My primary research focus is in figuring out how galaxies build different elements. 
[//]:  I think a deep understanding of physical conditions affecting the production and distribution of 
[//]:  chemicals in galaxies is crucial for solving the age-old mystery of our existence on earth. 
[//]:  By integrating observational techniques with computer simulations, my research is pushing
[//]:  the boundary of observational astronomy.

My other passion is baking. A [multiseed sourdough bread](https://anshu02gupta.github.io/hobbies/) is the highlight 
from my recent baking adventures.
