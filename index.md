I am an astrophysicist with broad interest in understanding the origin and evolution of 
galaxies like our own Milky Way. Particularly I am intersted in how galaxies build different elements. 
I think a deep understanding of physical conditions affecting the production and distribution of 
chemicals in galaxies is crucial for solving the age-old mystery of our existence on earth. 

Using optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations of galaxies from some of the largest telescopes in the world
 such as Keck in Hawaii and VLTs in Chile, I try to understand evolution in kinematic, chemical and other inter stellar
  medium properties of galaxies over the past 12 billion years. Additionally, I use state-of-the-art 
  hydrodynamical simulations and theoretical models to present a deeper understanding of my results. 
  By integrating observational techniques with computer simulations, my research is pushing
the boundary of observational astronomy.

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.physics.unsw.edu.au/staff/anshu-gupta), Sydney. 
I did my graduate studies at Australian National University, Canberra with Prof. Lisa Kewley and Dr. Tiantian Yuan. 
I grew up in India. I did a dual bachelors and masters degree in Physics at 
one of the highly prestigious school for undergraduate science education, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali.  

My other passion is baking. A [multiseed sourdough bread](https://anshu02gupta.github.io/others/) is the highlight 
from my recent baking adventures.
