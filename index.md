I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.physics.unsw.edu.au/staff/anshu-gupta), Sydney. 
My research focuses on the understanding the details of galaxy formation and evolution, 
with a special focus on how they build different elements. 
I think a deep understanding of physical conditions affecting the production and distribution of 
chemicals in galaxies is essential for solving the mystery of our
existence on earth.

I use direct observations from some of the largest telescopes in the world, and
state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations to understand the origin and evolution of 
galaxies like our own Milky Way. By integrating observational techniques with computer simulations, my research is pushing
the boundary of observational astronomy.

My other passion is baking. A [multiseed sourdough bread](https://anshu02gupta.github.io/others/) is the highlight 
from my recent baking adventures.
